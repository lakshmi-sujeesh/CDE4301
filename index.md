## 1. Introduction and Background

Myopia, also known as Nearsightedness, is an eye condition caused by a refractive error that makes far-away objects look blurry. This condition occurs when the shape of the eye causes light to focus in front of the retina—a light-sensitive tissue layer at the back of the eye—instead of directly on it. Myopic patients often have trouble seeing faraway objects and may need to squint to bring them into focus ​[1]​. Eye strain, where the eyes feel tired or sore, is a frequent symptom, and some people may also experience headaches, though this is less common [1]. 

Myopia may progress into high myopia or severe nearsightedness (more than 6 diopters of myopia) [2], where patients may be at higher risk for severe ocular conditions such as cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and myopic macular degeneration, all of which may lead to permanent vision loss [3]. To mitigate the severe complications associated with high myopia, early intervention is crucial to minimize the risk of myopia progression in children. 

### 1.1. Prevalence and Incidence of Myopia

Globally, there is higher myopia prevalence rates in school children in East Asia at 73%, compared to 42% in North America, while there was significantly lower prevalence of under 10% in African and South American children [3]. By 2050, 50% and 10% of the world will have myopia and high myopia, respectively [3]. In Singapore, the prevalence of myopia is among the highest in the world, with 65% of children being myopic by Primary 6, and 83% of young adults being myopic [4]. According to projection done by the Ministry of Health, 10% of children in Singapore will be myopic by 5 years old, 60% by 12 years old and 80% by 18 years old [5]. 

Myopia progression is fastest between ages 7 and 18, stabilizing as corneal curvature development completes. Thus, this project targets myopic children aged 7–18, as interventions beyond this age offer minimal benefits [6][7]. 

### 1.2 Existing Myopia Control Options

When a child presents themselves with rapidly progressing myopia (faster than –1.25 diopters/year) [8], treatment options for myopia progression control include prescription of Atropine eye drops, myopia control soft contact lenses, Ortho-keratology (Ortho-k) hard lenses, myopia control spectacles and combination therapy (Figure 1).

<p align=center>Figure 1: Comparison of different myopia control methods</p>
</div>


The efficacy of these myopia control methods is comparable to each other, are highly dependent on the individual’s preference and can have varying efficacies among different children (Appendix 7.1.) [10]. Hence, it is important that children are open to accepting the various treatment modalities that can best help control their myopia early. 

## 2. Problem Clarification

### 2.1. Data Collection

For this project, three key stakeholders, namely myopic children, parents, and clinicians – ophthalmologists and optometrists, have been identified. To better understand current practices and problems faced by our stakeholders, interviews with numerous myopic patients, ophthalmologists and optometrists were conducted (n=35). Surveys were also sent out to myopic patients across all age ranges across Asia (n=105) to better understand patient preferences towards the various myopia correction methods and what shaped their choices to opt for one modality over the other. (Interview and survey findings are in appendix 7.2.).

### 2.3. Stakeholder Needs

Based on interviews with stakeholders, key insights were extracted to better understand why most parents and children choose not to opt for myopia control contact lenses when presented with the option (Appendix 7.2.). These insights then translated into need statements and used to inform the product’s design requirements as shown below in Table 2.

### 2.4. Problem Statement

Myopic children and their parents face significant challenges in adopting myopia control contact lenses due to concerns about the safety, hygiene, and ease of current lens insertion and removal methods. These concerns deter them from choosing this option, which may have greater efficacy in slowing myopia progression for their child. Consequently, intervention is often delayed, limiting access to effective myopia management and increasing the risk of the child’s vision progressing to high myopia at an early age, along with its associated severe ocular complications.

### 2.5. Need Statement

This project aims to improve the user-friendliness of contact lenses’ insertion and removal process to increase acceptance rates among myopic children aged 7 to 18 in Singapore from the current 20% acceptance rates (Appendix 7.2.3.) to 30% (Appendix 7.2.1), thereby reducing the risk of high myopia and its associated complications.

## 3. Value Proposition

From the stakeholder needs, the value proposition statement has identified to be:

Our contact lens insertion and removal tool help myopic children aged 7-18 in Singapore who want to wear myopia control contact lenses by allowing them to do so safely and comfortably without depending on help from parents. 

Unlike existing contact lens insertion and removal methods such as usage of fingers, plunger or tweezer applicators, our tool allows children to insert and remove contact lenses independently in a user-friendly manner, without fear of hurting their eyeball surface.

### 4.2. Selected Concept

Weights were assigned for the 3 main pain points identified by stakeholders based on the importance that they ranked these pain points in the survey. 

For the tool safety perception category, the flip out spectacles was ranked the highest as the concept of using spectacles is already very familiar and comfortable to children, making them more likely to perceive it as a safe option for lens insertion. 

Looking at the lens hygiene aspect of the tool, the eyewash cup was ranked the lowest as it requires transferring from the lens packaging to the plunger using fingers, while the flip out spectacles comes directly out of the packaging and hence does not require any external lens contact by the user. 

The eyewash cup and flip out spectacles are equally convenient to use, given that they can be carried around and stored in a safe and clean manner, without the need to find a mirror to check lens alignment on cornea. For the finger glove suction, it is slightly less convenient to use as the user might require a mirror to check positioning and alignment before insertion and removal of lens. 
Given these ratings for the selection criteria, concept 2, the flip out spectacles have been deemed to be the selected concept as it significantly outweighed the other concepts.

## 5. Initial Prototyping, Testing and Challenges

As of the date of submission of this report, the prototyping and testing has been focused towards refining the specifications of the suction plunger feature design within concept 2 to be able to properly secure the lens for insertion and removal.  Soft lenses from J&J Acuvue have been used in all testing conducted by far.
Three types of work-like suction plungers were used as preliminary model to mimic the force and shape of the suction plunger design as shown below in Figures 5a and 5b. DMV plunger made of rubber latex and suction cup made of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) were used as prototypes for testing on a spherical plastic surface that was intended to mimic the corneal surface, with a diameter of 28mm, similar to that of the human eye [18] (Figure 5c).  To better simulate the moisture of human eye's tear film layer, 3 drops of saline solution was applied to the spherical surface during testing.

### 5.1. Testing of adherence of lens insertion – Automatic force application

Testing of lens adherence on the corneal surface was done using a Vertical Automatic Handy Test stand, where the PVC Suction cup with soft lens attached was set to shift down till it reaches compression point on the sphere, following which it would shift up to measure the tensional force at a constant rate of 2 mm/minute. The set-up is as shown in Figure 6 below.

The purpose of this test was to determine the minimal force required by the suction cup at the point where the lens adheres onto the mimicked corneal surface. This is to set a baseline value that the prototype plunger should meet when it is designed. This value can be identified using the peak noticed in the graph as shown in the aspirational plot shown below (Figure 7), obtained due to the upward force of the spherical surface on the force sensor due to the compression experienced upon contact. 

During testing, the expected force stabilization graph was not obtained; instead, the force values continued to increase without reaching a peak. This behaviour can likely be attributed to the surface compliance of the silicone hydrogel material used in the soft contact lens and the silicone suction cup. These materials may have deformed under compression, leading to continuous resistance and preventing a stable maximum force measurement from being achieved [19][20].

Moreover, the recorded forces were unexpectedly high, reaching values around 90 N, which significantly exceeds the typical forces experienced by the eyeball during aggressive actions such as rubbing eyes with knuckles (less than 20 N) [21]. This discrepancy might be due to excessive compression of the lenses caused by the preset movement rate of 2 mm/min in the testing setup. Such high forces are unsuitable for real-world lens insertion on the eyeball due to safety concerns.

To address this issue, a refined testing method is required to apply an appropriate force to the spherical “eye” surface while avoiding excessive compression of the lenses. This adjustment would better simulate realistic conditions and ensure that the forces remain within safe and clinically relevant ranges.

### 5.2. Testing of adherence of lens insertion – Manual force application

Given the inconclusive results from the Automatic Handy Test stand, the testing setup was modified to use a manual force gauge mounted on a test stand (Figure 8). This alternative manual method allowed for better control over compression, as the downward motion of the force sensor was stopped immediately upon observing full contact between the lens and the “eye” surface, before it was lifted back up so that the suction cup no longer has any contact on the lens surface, and the contact lens have been detached from the suction cup. 

A video recording was made to document the process, and the highest force value observed during the manual lowering of the sensor was recorded. This peak force represented the moment of contact between the lens and the surface, offering a clearer indication of the force required for adherence. This process was repeated thrice to ensure repeatability of results and the average peak force was calculated (Table 6). 

This entire experiment was repeated with the 45-degree and 90-degree DMV Plunger (Figure 9). The purpose of this was to check if contact angle of the lens on the surface made an impact on the peak force needed to place the lens. The values are recorded in Table 6, and as shown, the peak force required by the 45-degree DMV plunger was lesser than that of the 90 degree one, indicating that a 45-degree angle would be preferred for lens insertion such that there will be minimal force exerted on the corneal surface. This finding aligns with insights from the literature, which explains that at a 45-degree angle, forces are distributed through a rolling motion, whereas at 90 degrees, a more direct compressive force is applied. The rolling motion at 45 degrees allows for better alignment of the lens and a more uniform spread of the tear film, reducing resistance due to capillary effects [23]. 

Therefore, moving forward, different materials of the plunger at a 45 degree insertion angle can be tested out to determine the most suitable material to provide minimal insertion peak force.

### 5.3. Testing of adherence of lens removal

The experiment conducted in 5.2. was repeated, except the purpose of the experiment was to now detach the contact lens on the “eyeball” surface by shifting up the force sensor manually. However, both angled DMV plungers as well as the silicon suction cup failed to adhere onto the surface of the contact lens strong enough to lift it off the eyeball surface, and hence no force values could be recorded. This indicates that the upward suction force exerted by the plunger materials (silicon and latex rubber) was insufficient to overcome the surface tension forces around the contact lens periphery pulling the lens toward the cornea. 

Thus, moving forward, further testing needs to be conducted after using different type of plunger materials and sizes to see which one is the most suitable in being able to provide sufficient upward lifting force.

## 6. Future Work

To build upon the progress made so far, a projected timeline for the next phases of work is illustrated in Figure 8. The current stage focuses on preliminary engineering, which involves constructing individual components and procuring materials for testing. Subsequent steps will include conducting experiments on the other elements of the selected concept, integrating these parts into a cohesive prototype, and initiating testing and quality checks between late February and March. This schedule ensures sufficient time for iterative modifications and detailed documentation before the final deliverables are prepared in April and May.

Component testing will be conducted in a laboratory setting to address biohazard risks associated with using porcine eyeballs as part of the evaluations. Additionally, testing the complete concept in a clinical environment will be vital to gather on-the-ground feedback from healthcare professionals. This input will be critical for refining and improving the prototype to meet practical healthcare needs.
